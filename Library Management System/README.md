Certainly! Below is a sample documentation that outlines how to run the application, interact with its API endpoints, and any considerations regarding authentication if it's implemented in your library management system.

## Library Management System API Documentation

### Overview

The Library Management System API provides endpoints for managing patrons, books, and borrowing records. This documentation outlines how to run the application, interact with its endpoints, and any authentication considerations.

### Running the Application

To run the Library Management System application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. **Build the Application:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar target/library-management-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

   Replace `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` with the actual version generated by Maven.

4. **Access the Application:**
   The application will be running on `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the API.

### API Endpoints

#### Patrons

- **GET /api/patrons**
    - Retrieves a list of all patrons.

- **GET /api/patrons/{id}**
    - Retrieves details of a specific patron by ID.

- **POST /api/patrons**
    - Adds a new patron to the system.

- **PUT /api/patrons/{id}**
    - Updates an existing patron's information.

- **DELETE /api/patrons/{id}**
    - Removes a patron from the system.

#### Books

- **GET /api/books**
    - Retrieves a list of all books.

- **GET /api/books/{id}**
    - Retrieves details of a specific book by ID.

- **POST /api/books**
    - Adds a new book to the system.

- **PUT /api/books/{id}**
    - Updates an existing book's information.

- **DELETE /api/books/{id}**
    - Removes a book from the system.

#### Borrowing Records

- **POST /api/borrow/{bookId}/patron/{patronId}**
    - Allows a patron to borrow a book.

- **PUT /api/return/{bookId}/patron/{patronId}**
    - Records the return of a borrowed book by a patron.

### Authentication

If authentication is implemented in the system, it will be required to access certain endpoints. Here's how you can authenticate:

- **Authentication Method:** [Specify authentication method, e.g., JWT, OAuth2]

- **Endpoints Requiring Authentication:** [List endpoints that require authentication]

### Error Handling

The API handles errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Here are common error scenarios and their HTTP status codes:

- **404 Not Found:** When a requested resource (e.g., patron, book) is not found.
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request format or data.
- **409 Conflict:** When attempting to add a resource (e.g., patron, book) that already exists.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Unexpected server error.

### Examples

#### Example: Add a Patron

**Request:**
```bash
POST /api/patrons
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "phoneNumber": "1234567890"
}
```

### Notes

- Replace `{id}`, `{bookId}`, and `{patronId}` with actual IDs in your requests.
- Ensure proper authentication credentials are included if required.
